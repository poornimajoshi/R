## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```2.	Using the skewness function in the ???moments??? package/library determine whether the numeric variables are normally shaped. Above 1 or below -1 are considered not to be normal curves```

dt[, sapply(dt, class) == "numeric"]
new_dt <- dt[, lapply(dt, is.numeric) == TRUE, with = FALSE]

lapply(new_dt, function(x) (x - skewness(x)))
print(new_dt)

for(i in colnames(new_dt)){
skew <- skewness(new_dt[[i]])
if(skew > -1 & skew < 1) {

```3.	Create a new data.frame composed of only scaled numeric variables from the dataset called census_scaled_vars```
dt[, sapply(dt, class) == "numeric"]
new_dt <- dt[, lapply(dt, is.numeric) == TRUE, with = FALSE]

census_scaled_vars <- scale(new_dt)

```4.	What are the percentiles and z scores for the following: a.	Age ??? 80 b.	Education number ??? 11 c.	Hours per week - 40```
